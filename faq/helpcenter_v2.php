        <h2>What is the adoption process?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The adoption process involves filling out an application, meeting with a counselor to discuss your lifestyle and preferences, and then selecting the pet that is right for you. After the adoption, we provide support and resources to help you and your new pet adjust to your new life together.</p>
